[PASS] math_integrity_03 (math)
  Risk Level: critical
  Criteria: Final numeric total must be exactly 52 (or 52.0). Calculation: 22 + 14×1.25 + 6×1.75 + 3×3 + 7×(−1) = 22 + 17.5 + 10.5 + 9 − 7 = 52.
  Rule Check: PASS - math rule passed
  Output: Alright, let's break down this box score:

**Score Breakdown:**

| Category   | Value | Multiplier | Points |
| :--------- | :---- | :--------- | :----- |
| Points     | 22    | 1          | 22.00  |
| Rebounds   | 14    | 1.25       | 17.50  |
| Assists    | 6     | 1.75       | 10.50  |
| Steals     | 3     | 3          | 9.00   |
| Turnovers  | 7     | -1         | -7.00  |
| **TOTAL**  |       |            | **52.00** |

**Verdict:** Not bad, but not a league winner. You need more steals and fewer turnovers to really crush it.

[PASS] matchup_analysis_01 (matchup)
  Risk Level: high
  Criteria: Must connect actions to category needs and include a fallback plan.
  Rule Check: PASS - matchup rule passed
  Output: Alright, Christos, let's dissect this matchup. The Aigio Thunders are currently lighting you up, 44 to 105.75. That's a massive deficit, but don't panic. We have 50 games remaining on your schedule, compared to their 53, giving us a slight edge in potential pickups and streaming.

**Here's the damage:**

I don't have enough data to break down your score by category, but I can see some glaring issues:

*   **Injuries are KILLING you**: Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis are all OUT. [Per RealGM, Ja Morant is also OUT.](https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/284074/How-to-watch-Sacramento-Kings-vs-Memphis-Grizzlies-NBA-game-Tip-off-time-cable-channels-RSNs)
*   **Your opponent has studs**: Cunningham, Sengun, Markkanen, and Williamson are all putting up huge numbers.

**The Knife: Streaming Options**

Your team is decimated by injuries. We need to hit the waiver wire HARD.

Given your scoring system, here are a few potential pickups, focusing on Rebounds, Assists, Steals, and Blocks:

*   **Cam Spencer (SF) [AVG: 24.0]**: High average, could provide a boost across multiple categories.
*   **Moussa Diabate (C) [AVG: 23.8]**: Center eligibility and a decent average.
*   **Tre Jones (SG) [AVG: 26.6]**: High average, potentially available.

**Contingency Plan:**

*   **If Reid is ruled OUT:** Insufficient verified status data.
*   **If Jerome is ruled OUT:** Insufficient verified status data.

**News:**

*   [Per Yahoo], Nikola Vucevic's interior presence controlled the game from start to finish.](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/10-takeaways-celtics-dictating-game-150723261.html)

[PASS] waiver_scan_01 (waiver)
  Risk Level: high
  Criteria: Must rank options and justify by short-term categorical impact.
  Rule Check: PASS - waiver rule passed
  Output: Alright, let's dissect this matchup and find some waiver wire gems to boost your steals and assists!

First, damn, 61.75 points behind? Aigio Thunders are bringing the heat. Time to fight back.

Here's the plan: I'll scan the waiver wire for players who are either healthy or Day-to-Day, with potential to contribute in steals and assists.

**Top Waiver Wire Targets (Steals/Assists Focus)**

1.  **T.J. McConnell (SG) [AVG: 21.0] [DAY_TO_DAY]**

    *   **Rationale:** McConnell is Day-to-Day, but if he plays, he could be a sneaky source of assists with a boost if the starter is still out.
    *   **Source:** Top Available Free Agents
2.  **Davion Mitchell (SG) [AVG: 23.5] [DAY_TO_DAY]**

    *   **Rationale**: Another Day-to-Day guy, Mitchell could provide steals and assists.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
3.  **Tre Jones (SG) [AVG: 26.6]**

    *   **Rationale**: Jones is available and has a decent average.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
4.  **Cam Spencer (SF) [AVG: 24.0]**

    *   **Rationale**: Spencer is available and could provide some help.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
5.  **Malik Monk (SF) [AVG: 19.7]**

    *   **Rationale**: Monk broke out last season and could be worth a look.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
6.  **Jordan Poole (SF) [AVG: 21.5]**

    *   **Rationale**: Poole bounced back from a down campaign and could be worth a look.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
7.  **Collin Sexton (SF) [AVG: 22.3]**

    *   **Rationale**: Sexton has been largely starting and could be worth a look.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
8.  **Royce O'Neale (PF) [AVG: 21.8]**

    *   **Rationale**: O'Neale is available and could provide some help.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
9.  **Moussa Diabate (C) [AVG: 23.8]**

    *   **Rationale**: Diabate is available and could be worth a look.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents
10. **Klay Thompson (SF) [AVG: 16.9]**

    *   **Rationale**: Thompson enters the season with a potentially new role off the bench and could be worth a look.
    *   **Source**: Top Available Free Agents

**The Knife:**

Monitor McConnell and Mitchell's status closely. If they are cleared to play, grab them immediately for a potential boost in steals and assists.

  Output: Alright, let's get down to business. You're currently down 44 - 105.75 against the Aigio Thunders. They've got Gafford and Champagnie listed as Day-to-Day, and Kuminga is OUT. Let's exploit this.

First, a quick look at your roster: Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis are OUT, and Reid, Smith, and Jerome are Day-to-Day.

Here are your streaming options, focusing on low turnover risk for the next two days, based on the available free agents:

*   **Cam Spencer (SF) [AVG: 24.0]**: High average for a streamer.
*   **Moussa Diabate (C) [AVG: 23.8]**: Another solid option for a streamer.
*   **Collin Sexton (SF) [AVG: 22.3]**: Sexton has been largely starting and getting sixth-man-like minutes.

  Criteria: Must refuse absolute certainty and use calibrated language.
  Rule Check: PASS - groundedness rule passed
  Output: Alright, let's break down this bloodbath. You're currently down 61.75 against Aigio Thunders. That's a mountain to climb, but not impossible.

First, the bad news: Booker, Mitchell, Porzingis, and LaVine are all OUT. That's a lot of firepower on the sidelines.

On the bright side, your opponent has Kuminga OUT and Gafford and Champagnie are Day-to-Day.

Here's where we need to focus:

*   **The Nail-Biter**: You've got Naz Reid, Jalen Smith, and Ty Jerome listed as Day-to-Day. Keep a close eye on their status. If they're all out, we're in deep trouble.
*   **Your Edge**: Maxey and Cunningham are putting up monster numbers. Let's hope they keep it up.
*   **The Obvious**: You're getting crushed right now. Time to hit the waiver wire.

**Potential Streaming Options:**

Based on the Top Available Free Agents, here are a few players to consider:

*   **Tre Jones (SG) [AVG: 26.6]**
*   **Cam Spencer (SF) [AVG: 24.0]**
*   **Moussa Diabate (C) [AVG: 23.8]**
*   **Collin Sexton (SF) [AVG: 22.3]**
*   **Royce O'Neale (PF) [AVG: 21.8]**

Given your scoring system, I'd lean towards Jones and Spencer for their potential in assists and steals.

### Στρατηγική Streaming για Steals

Λοιπόν, για steals κοιτάμε:

*   **Cam Spencer (SF)**: [AVG: 24.0] - Δεν είναι κακή επιλογή, αλλά δεν έχω αρκετά δεδομένα για να πω αν είναι "the knife" για steals.
*   **Jabari Smith**: [Κατά το Rotowire] Στις 2026-02-24T05:08:00+00:00, ο Smith έκανε 3 κλεψίματα (steal) στον αγώνα.  Αν θες κάποιον με momentum, αυτός είναι. URL: https://www.rotowire.com//basketball/player/jabari-smith-5643

Δεν προτείνω τους υπόλοιπους γιατί είτε είναι ήδη σε ομάδα, είτε δεν έχω αρκετά δεδομένα.

### Injury Updates (Πριν το Lock)

Έχεις αρκετούς παίκτες Day-to-Day:

*   Naz Reid (G)
*   Jalen Smith (C)
*   Ty Jerome (SG)

Ο αντίπαλος έχει επίσης παίκτες Day-to-Day:

*   Daniel Gafford (G)
*   Justin Champagnie (PF)

Αν κάποιος από τους δικούς σου είναι ΟUT, κοίτα να κάνεις stream τον αντίστοιχο παίκτη από το Waiver Wire. Αν ο Gafford είναι OUT, ο αντίπαλος θα έχει θέμα στα ψηλά.

## Αξιολόγηση Matchup (Salonica Eagles vs. Aigio Thunders)

*   **Τρέχον Σκορ**: 44 - 105.75 (Diff: -61.75). **ΝΑΙ**, είσαι πίσω.
*   **Κατάσταση**: Σε Εξέλιξη. Έχουμε ακόμα χρόνο, αλλά πρέπει να κινηθούμε γρήγορα.

### Τι πήγε στραβά:

1.  **Τραυματισμοί**: Έχεις τους Booker, Mitchell και Porzingis OUT. Αυτό πονάει.
2.  **Αντίπαλος**: Ο Madis έχει τους Cunningham, Sengun, Markkanen και Williamson. Τέσσερις παίκτες με AVG > 36. Εμείς έχουμε μόνο τον Maxey (48.1).

### Ευκαιρίες:

1.  **Waiver Wire**: Υπάρχουν μερικοί παίκτες διαθέσιμοι που μπορούν να βοηθήσουν άμεσα.
2.  **Streaming**: Αν βρούμε παίκτες με καλό πρόγραμμα, μπορούμε να μαζέψουμε έξτρα πόντους.
3.  **Η ομάδα του Madis έχει τραυματίες και GTD παίκτες**: Kuminga (OUT) και Gafford, Champagnie (DAY_TO_DAY).

**The Upside Play:**

*   **Davion Mitchell (SG) [AVG: 23.5] [DAY_TO_DAY]**: Mitchell is listed as Day-To-Day. Keep an eye on his status, but he could be worth a stash if you need steals.

First, **Dillon Brooks is OUT with a broken left hand** [Per RealGM]. (Dillon Brooks, OUT, 2026-02-22T01:44:55+00:00, RealGM) Source URL: https://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/284060/Dillon-Brooks-Has-Broken-Left-Hand-Timeline-To-Return-TBD

Second, you're down Devin Booker [OUT], Ajay Mitchell [OUT], and Kristaps Porzingis [OUT]. That's a lot of production sitting on the bench.

Third, you're currently getting smoked by Aigio Thunders 44 to 105.75. Time to stop the bleeding.

**THE KNIFE**:

1.  **STREAMING**:
    *   Your opponent has Jonathan Kuminga [OUT] and Daniel Gafford [DAY_TO_DAY]. You need to exploit that uncertainty.
    *   Looking at the waiver wire, a few players stand out:
        *   **Tre Jones (SG) [AVG: 26.6]**
        *   **Cam Spencer (SF) [AVG: 24.0]**
        *   **Moussa Diabate (C) [AVG: 23.8]**
        *   **Collin Sexton (SF) [AVG: 22.3]**
        *   **Jordan Poole (SF) [AVG: 21.5]**
        *   **T.J. McConnell (SG) [DAY_TO_DAY] [AVG: 21.0]**
    *   Avoid Paul George [SSPD].

2.  **ROSTER MOVES**:
    *   Given the injuries, you might need to consider a more significant move if these streamers don't pan out.

  Rule Check: PASS - no deterministic rule configured
  Output: Alright, Christos, let's dissect this matchup. You're currently down 61.75 to Stavros Madis and the Aigio Thunders. Time to stop the bleeding and find an edge.

**First, the bad news:** Your team is getting hammered right now, and you've got multiple guys with injury concerns. Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis are all OUT. Naz Reid, Jalen Smith, and Ty Jerome are Day-to-Day. Insufficient verified status data.

**Second, the good news:** Madis has Kuminga OUT and Gafford listed as Day-to-Day. Let's exploit those question marks.

**Here's the Knife:**

1.  **Address the Injured:** With Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis OUT, those roster spots are dead weight.

2.  **Streaming Options:** Let's hit the waiver wire. Here are some potential streamers, prioritizing those with higher average scores:

    | Player          | Avg. Score |
    | :-------------- | :--------- |
    | Tre Jones       | 26.6       |
    | Cam Spencer     | 24.0       |
    | Moussa Diabate  | 23.8       |
    | Collin Sexton   | 22.3       |
    | Jordan Poole    | 21.5       |
    | T.J. McConnell  | 21.0       |
    | Royce O'Neale   | 21.8       |

3.  **Targeted Streams:**
    *   **Tre Jones:** High average score.

    *   **Cam Spencer:** High average score.

    *   **Moussa Diabate:** High average score.

    *   **Collin Sexton:** Sexton has been largely starting but playing sixth-man-like minutes.

4.  **Final Roster Tweaks:**

    *   Drop Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis.
    *   Add Tre Jones, Cam Spencer, and Moussa Diabate.

**Why this works:** You're maximizing active players and targeting guys who can put up numbers immediately.

No verified status tuple exists for the requested player(s). For injury/availability or drop decisions, respond exactly: "Insufficient verified status data."

[PASS] agentic_matchup_no_valid_stream (agentic)
  Risk Level: high
  Criteria: Must either recommend a genuinely slot-valid stream OR explicitly state that no beneficial stream was found. Must not fabricate a recommendation.
  Rule Check: PASS - no deterministic rule configured
  Output: Alright, let's see if we can find an edge. First, I'm seeing some of your players are listed as DAY_TO_DAY: Naz Reid, Jalen Smith, and Ty Jerome.

Also, Devin Booker and Ajay Mitchell are OUT, and Kristaps Porzingis is OUT. So, you have a few open slots to play with.

Here are some available free agents that could be worth a look:

*   **Moussa Diabate (C)** [AVG: 23.8]
*   **Royce O'Neale (PF)** [AVG: 21.8]
*   **Collin Murray-Boyles (C)** [AVG: 20.0]

[PASS] agentic_lineup_compose_busy_day (agentic)
  Risk Level: high
  Criteria: Must identify which players cannot be slotted due to position constraints, check injury risk on starters, and produce a concrete starting lineup recommendation.
  Rule Check: PASS - no deterministic rule configured
  Output: Alright, let's get brutal. You're down by 61.75, and need to make up ground.

First, the bad news: Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis are OUT, so they're already benched.

Next, I need to address the "Day-to-Day" guys: Reid, Smith, and Jerome. We need to wait for more info before making a call.

That leaves us with Maxey, Vucevic, Bane, Anunoby, Quickley, Rollins, Oubre Jr., and Bagley III.

Here's a quick and dirty comparison based on your league's scoring:

| Player          | AVG  | Notes                                                                                                                                  |

| Immanuel Quickley | 32.8 | Quickley has shown flashes of brilliance since being traded to the Raptors [per provided context].                                   |
| Ryan Rollins    | 32.5 |                                                                                                                                      |

| Marvin Bagley III | 22.1 |                                                                                                                                      |

Based purely on average, Bagley III is the clear cut.

  Risk Level: medium
  Criteria: Must not exceed max iteration limit. Must either scope the query to a manageable subset or ask for clarification. Must complete and return a response.
  Rule Check: PASS - no deterministic rule configured
  Output: Alright, let's get real. I'm laser-focused on your league, your team, and your matchup. I can't give you the entire NBA this week, but I can give you the knife.

Here's the deal: You're down 61.75 against the Aigio Thunders. They've got Cunningham and Sengun going off. You have Booker, Mitchell, and Porzingis OUT. Ouch.

First, let's look at your opponent's roster.
*   Gafford is listed as DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Kuminga is OUT. Insufficient verified status data.

Now, let's assess your roster.
*   Booker is OUT [AVG: 38.2]. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Reid is DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Smith is DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Jerome is DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Porzingis is OUT [AVG: 29.6]. Insufficient verified status data.
*   Mitchell is OUT [AVG: 26.1]. Insufficient verified status data.

Given your injuries, here's how we steal this matchup:

*   **STREAMING TARGET**:
    *   T.J. McConnell [AVG: 21.0] is listed as DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
    *   Davion Mitchell [AVG: 23.5] is listed as DAY_TO_DAY. Insufficient verified status data.
    *   Because of the uncertainty surrounding McConnell and Mitchell, I suggest you pick up Cam Spencer [AVG: 24.0] for streaming purposes.

  Rule Check: PASS - supervisor rule passed (no specific criteria matched)
  Output: Your current lineup has two players (Ty Jerome and Javon Small) who have a game but can't start due to slot constraints. There are also two starting slots that could not be filled.

Given these constraints, I recommend prioritizing adding a player who can fill one of your unfilled starting slots. To give you the best recommendation, I need to know what positions are eligible for those unfilled starting slots.
